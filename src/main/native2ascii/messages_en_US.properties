what.is.a.pudu=What is a Pudú
content.what.is.a.pudu=The <span class="TextoRersaltado">Pudús</span> are two species of South \
American and the world´s smallest deer. They live on the slopes of the Andes Mountain Range \
from southern Chile and southwestern Argentina. <br /><br /><br />\
The Pudús range in size from 30 to 40 centimeters tall and up to 90 centimeters long and weighs \
from 7 to 10 kilograms. The Pudú is a solitary and nocturnal animal except of the reproduction period.<br /><br /><br />\
The pudús are herbivorous, consuming vines, leaves from low trees, shrubs, succulent sprouts, herbs, \
ferns, blossoms, buds, tree bark, and fallen fruit. Their coat is a dark chestnut-brown, and tends \
to tuft in the front, covering the antlers. <br /><br /><br />\
Fawns have reddish brown fur and Southern Pudú fawns \
have white spots running the length of their back. Females mature sexually in 6 months while males \
mature in 8–12 months. Fawns are fully grown in 3 months but may stay with their mothers for 8 to 12 months.
